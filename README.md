Bran The Builder. I am known to build walls but last I built a pen-holder and cable organising clip. Baby steps they say.


## TODO:
- Figure a way to connect to the raven and create a pipeline to print without touching raven
- Note taking and config management for prints to track failed, successful and iteration over prints
- UI to let others suggest with STL or ideas.
- Live health and metrics from raven
- Get correct configs for raven.
